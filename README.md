Froggy Commerce API is a backend API designed to manage an e-commerce system. It provides endpoints to manage products, customers, administrators, shopping carts, and payment processes. This API is designed to be flexible, secure, and easy to integrate with e-commerce user interfaces.

## üöÄ Features

- **User and Roles Control:** Implements a user and roles management system to ensure security and control access to the API functionality. This includes creating customer accounts and assigning specific roles to users.

- **Security Measures:** The API implements security measures such as user authentication using JWT tokens, role-based authorization, and data validation to protect data and ensure proper access control.

- **Administrators:** Administrators can manage products (create, update, delete), manage product stock, and view and manage all existing customers on the platform.

- **Customers:** Customers can view products, update their user profile, manage shipping and billing addresses, and add, delete, and update products in the shopping cart.

- **Login and Registration:** Endpoints are provided for user registration and authentication on the platform, using a secure system based on JWT tokens.

- **Payment Link Generation:** The application allows generating a payment link for products in the user's shopping cart, facilitating the purchase process.

- **Integration with Mercado Pago:** Integrates with Mercado Pago to manage payment processes efficiently and securely.

- **Swagger Documentation:** Uses Swagger to document the API clearly and accessibly.

    git clone https://github.com/Sapitorico/FroggyCommerce-api.git
    cd FroggyCommerce-api
    ```

2. Configure the `.env` file as shown in the Docker installation section.

3. Run the following command to create the database and load the schema from the create_db.sh script:

    ```bash
    ./create_db.sh
    ```

4. Create and activate a virtual environment for Python:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## üí≥ Mercado Pago Integration

Froggy Commerce integrates with Mercado Pago to manage payment processes efficiently and securely. To use this integration, follow these steps:

1. Create an account on [Mercado Pago](https://www.mercadopago.com/).

2. Get your Mercado Pago API credentials, including your Access Token.

3. Configure your application to use the Mercado Pago credentials. This may involve setting environment variables in your `.env` file:

    ```dotenv
    MERCADO_PAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
    ```

4. Follow the instructions in the Mercado Pago documentation to set up the necessary webhooks to receive payment notifications.

5. If you are working in a local environment and want to test Mercado Pago payment functionalities, you will need to expose your local server to the internet using a tool like ngrok to create a tunnel and obtain a public URL. Make sure to configure your application to use this URL, including the scheme (HTTP or HTTPS) and the server name in your `.env` file:

    ```dotenv
    URL_SCHEME=https
    SERVER_NAME=your_ngrok_url_here
    ```

6. That's it! You can now start using the Mercado Pago payment functionalities in your Froggy Commerce application.
